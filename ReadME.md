- Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/CatsInTech/Rezume/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Gitflow](https://github.com/CatsInTech/Rezume/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for contributing towards the project.
- Write clear meaningful git commit messages (Do read [this](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)).
- Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged. (Check [this](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests) for more info)
- When you make very very minor changes to a PR of yours (like for example fixing a text in button, minor changes requested by reviewers) make sure you squash your commits afterwards so that you don't have an absurd number of commits for a very small fix. (Learn how to squash at [here](https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git))
- When you're submitting a PR for a UI-related issue, it would be really awesome if you add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. It makes it very easy for the reviewers and you'll also get reviews quicker.
- Please follow the [PR Template](https://github.com/CatsInTech/Rezume/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to create the PR.
- Always create PR to `develop` branch.
